description: "Implement a Douban book data scraping module to collect over 100,000+ book entries and 200,000+ user records,
storing this data in a PostgreSQL relational database engineered to 3NF. The system features a Flask-RESTful server
that integrates Deepseek-V3’s large model API and employs a hybrid recommendation algorithm. The functionality
includes the admin panel for book CRUD operations and inventory dashboards, plus the User Portal with
categorized search, shopping cart transactions, hybrid algorithm-powered recommendations, and AI-driven Q&A."
