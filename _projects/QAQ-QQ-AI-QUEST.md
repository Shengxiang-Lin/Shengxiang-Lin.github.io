description: "This project implements a distributed security service architecture, utilizing RESTful APIs for frontend-backend network interfaces and SQLx for database construction. It integrates multiple multimodal large language models such as Deepseek and Doubao, employing the LLOneBot middleware to handle request routing and dialogue state management. The system supports dynamic persona response configuration for various contexts through methods like real-time prompt modification, and has been successfully deployed and operates stably on the QQ platform."
