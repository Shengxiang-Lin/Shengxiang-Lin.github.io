# üë¶ About Me            
Hi, I am **Shengxiang Lin ( ÊûóÂú£Áøî )**, undergraduate student of Qian Xuesen Honor College / Department of Electronics and Information Science, Zhongying College Computer Experimental Class 2201 ( expected graduation in July 2026 ). I was awarded the **National Scholarship**, **Huawei Scholarship**, **Xi'an Jiaotong University Outstanding Student**, **Xi'an Jiaotong University Outstanding Communist Youth League Member** and other honors. I won **the second prize of individual in the national finals of the Group Programming Ladder Competition**, **the third prize of the national finals of the C/C++ University A Group of the Blue Bridge Cup Programming Competition**, **the first prize of the Shaanxi Region of the National University Students' Mathematical Modeling Competition**, and **more than ten other awards of provincial-level and above competitions**. In the summer of 2024, I participated in the **Innovative Talents Science Training Program ( ITSTP )**, and co-authored one SCI paper. Participated in **Berkeley Global Access Program ( BGA )** in the fall of 2024. I am actively involved in volunteering as the **Co-Founder & Minster of XJTU Computer Science and Technology Experimental Class-Mentor-Group**, accumulating over 300 hours of work.     
My research interests mainly focus on
