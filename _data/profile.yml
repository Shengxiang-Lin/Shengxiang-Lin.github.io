  Hi, I am <strong>Shengxiang Lin (林圣翔)</strong>, an incoming Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MY23M60AAAAJ">Xiaolin Zheng</a>.
  I am currently completing my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology (Qian Xuesen Honor Program) at Xi'an Jiaotong University (2022-2026).
  In 2024, I completed the Berkeley Global Access Program as a nationally funded visiting student at UC Berkeley.   
  <br> My research interests primarily focus on <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.
  <br> <span style="color: red; font-style: italic;">Feel free to contact me if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me.</span>  
#  I shared some of the datasets and model weights used by the project at <a href="https://huggingface.co/wangrongsheng">🔗HuggingFace</a>. I likewise like to post some small-parameter LM at <a href="https://ollama.com/wangrongsheng">🔗Ollama</a> to help people use it locally.
